<h1>My Book Plan</h1>

<p>
<pre style="color:red;font-family:courier;font-size:90%"><i>
	Three rings for the elven kings under the sky
	Seven rings for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone
	Nine rings for mortal men doomed to die
	One Ring for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
	In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie

	One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them
	One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
	In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie</i>
</pre>
This is the poem from Lord of the Rings. Tolkien's amazing work of fiction.
</p>

<p>I am working on a fantasy series of my own: <cite>The Course of Being</cite> otherwise known as <cite>The Magefire Cycle</cite></p>

<h2>The Magefire Cycle</h2>

<p><cite>The Magefire Cycle</cite> tells the story of <b>Corin Sarxson</b>, a lone orphan with a mysterious past and mystical destiny. The blood of the Ancients <sup>The Quith</sup> flows in his veins and with the aid of his corestone ambienth he will
become a Sett Master and be the Lightcaster (maybe I should use a word that is a synonym of "omni").</p>

<p>There are several Elder Races. The first is the Aelf who are broken into two groups: the <small>Quith</small> and the <small>Kyth</small>.
